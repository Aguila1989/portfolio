              description="On October 22st, I attended a tech meet at Howest that featured a presentation on Baserow, an open-source database software. The speaker, who commenced at 19:00 and finished at 20:00, introduced Baserow as a versatile platform that simplifies database management. <br>
              He emphasized that with Baserow, you only pay for a license once, and you're ready to go.<br><br>
              Baserow is marketed as being more user-friendly than MySQL, offering built-in authentication and an extensive set of functions, such as roll-up formulas and built-in templates for easy database creation. <br>
              One standout feature is the ability to create views, including 'bread views,' without writing complex queries. <br>
              The software also offers a graphical interface to manage your database, allowing users to collaborate by tagging colleagues directly in the app, eliminating the need for external tools like Teams.<br><br>
              As an admin, you also have access to an audit log, which tracks every action taken. Baserow includes a task management system and dashboards that provide insights without requiring users to sift through spreadsheets. <br>
              The no-code builder makes it easy to create and manage a responsive front end without needing to write a single line. <br>
              Users can even automate API development through visual programming tools and predefined blocks.<br><br>
              The speaker showcased practical examples of Baserowâ€™s capabilities, including a smoothie ordering system and a city tour app that highlights key locations on a map. <br>
              He emphasized that since starting with Baserow in February, the platform has evolved rapidly, offering faster development cycles for low- or no-code applications, though with some limitations.<br><br>
              After the presentation, we gathered in the A-building for drinks, continuing discussions until 22:00 in a relaxed and informal setting. It was a great evening of learning, networking, and sharing ideas."
